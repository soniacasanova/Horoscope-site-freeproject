# Horoscope-site-freeproject
This is a mini project I am making to test my recent abilities with JavaScript, learned in the full stack postgraduate.

!important infoÂ¡
At the moment the cards will show as a first quote the same last quote as the horoscope you clicked previously, you need to click a second time to get the quotes for that specific sign. Just the first three ones work, since I am still working on it and I had some troubles, but soon enough will work correctly.

I am starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel with this one :D
